VERSION
    version 1.100851

SYNOPSIS
        $ perl -MDevel::TraceINC t/01_my_test.t
        Test/More.pm loaded from package main, file t/01_my_test.t, line 6
        Test/Builder/Module.pm loaded from package Test::More, file /usr/local/svn/perl/Test/More.pm, line 22

DESCRIPTION
    I had a situation where a program was loading a module but I couldn't
    find where in the code it was loaded. It turned out that I loaded some
    module, which loaded another module, which loaded the module in
    question. To be able to track down who loads what, I wrote
    Devel::TraceINC.

    Just "use()" the module and it will print a warning every time a module
    is searched for in @INC, i.e., loaded.
